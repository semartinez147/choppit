  <string name="loading_info">Choppit is working on retrieving useful information (and nothing else) from the page you found.</string>
  <string name="home_info">Welcome to Choppit!  \n\nThis is a cookbook app intended to simplify cooking from online recipes.  You can enter a recipe link on the home page, or tap "New Recipe" to get started with a blank recipe.  If you enter a recipe link, you\'ll be taken to a page where you can help Choppit find and extract only the ingredients and instructions from any website.  Otherwise, you\'ll be able to type that all in manually.  </string>
  <string name="selection_info">This screen loads text extracted from the link you used.  By identifying an example of an ingredient and a step in the recipe, Choppit is able to find all of the ingredients and instructions for the recipe, and chop them right out of the page for you.</string>
  <string name="editing_info">On this page, you have the option to edit any of the ingredients, amounts, or instructions in the recipe, as well as its name.  You can save multiple variations on one recipe link, as long as they each have different names.</string>
  <string name="cookbook_info">This is the list of recipes you\'ve saved to Choppit on your device.  You can search for something specific, or sort by recipes you\'ve favorited or edited.</string>
