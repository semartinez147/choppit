I'm a foodie, so I like to experiment with new recipes and tinker with them to get them just right.  I need a customizable cookbook so that I can collect great recipes, keep track of the adjustments I make, and impress dinner guests with my refined cuisine.

As a busy home chef, I cook dinner for my family several nights a week.  I need to access our favorite recipes quickly, and refer to measurements on the fly as I cook, so that everyone is happy with dinner and we have more family time after work and school.
